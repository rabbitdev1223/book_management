QE SENIOR FULL STACK DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENT

Context:
Please complete a small Library app in node.js (express) with ReactJS

Problem statement:
Create two APIs that’s secured by (JWT), and protected by roles,
Users with the role “CREATOR” can create books, API should be “/books”
Users with the role “VIEWER” can view books created by them. API should be “/books”
users with role “VIEW_ALL” can see all created books API should be “/books”
Users with the role “CREATOR” can also delete a book, API should be “/books/delete”
each user can have multiple roles
show books that were created 10 minutes ago and more in API “/books?old=1”
show books that were created less than 10 minutes ago “/books?new=1”
Show all the books in a tabular format in a website
Have filters and sorting option in the table along with the option to see books created within 10min ago and within 10min

The users with “CREATOR” role can do the following in the website
Have a “Add book” which asks the user to add the book to the DB
Have a “Delete” icon on each row of the table which gets the confirmation from the user, calls the delete API and removes the book from the DB
Have a “Edit” icon which allows the user to edit the details of the book

	
	The users with “VIEW_ALL” permission can only view the book and no action can be done in the website

Expectations:
Use a Mongo collection and it works when we switch to any mongodb
Keep the connection information in an environment property.
Basic validations must be there in the UI
Try to avoid any console warnings. There must not be any console errors.
Add a logger to log the API calls

Submission:
Once you are done, create a public repo on github and push your code.

Rough timeline: 24-48 hours. The sooner the submissions, the better your chances are!


ALL THE BEST
